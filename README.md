# RouterAngular

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.0.
We Use Rote To Navigate Any Page We Have:
Receipt System:
A receipt payment system records and manages payments received from customers. It creates official receipts, links payments to the right invoices, updates account balances, and ensures accurate financial tracking. Key features include support for multiple payment methods, real-time ledger updates, and reporting tools for better cash flow visibility.
A loan system is a software application designed to manage the full lifecycle of loans â€” from application to approval, disbursement, repayments, and closure. It helps lenders (banks, credit unions, microfinance institutions) handle loans efficiently while keeping track of borrower details, schedules, and payments.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
